# Yoga-Pose-Correctness-Detection
This project is a Yoga Pose Recognition System developed using machine learning techniques. The system accurately detects and classifies various yoga poses in real-time, providing users with feedback on the correctness of their posture.

The system utilizes the MediaPipe framework for pose estimation, extracting precise body coordinates from a live video feed. These coordinates are processed using a trained logistic regression model for pose classification. The model has been trained on a dataset of labeled yoga poses, enabling it to accurately recognize and classify a wide range of poses.

Key Features:

Real-time detection and classification of yoga poses
Integration of the MediaPipe framework for accurate pose estimation
Trained logistic regression model for pose classification
User-friendly interface with live video feed and pose accuracy feedback
The project is developed and available for use. It can be accessed on GitHub, providing an opportunity for exploration, usage, and potential contributions from yoga practitioners, researchers, and developers interested in yoga pose recognition.
